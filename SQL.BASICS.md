## 🗄️ Lesson 1: Basic SQL Commands

SQL is a language used to maintain relational databases.

### Creating a Database

To start working with SQLite:

```bash
sqlite3 pet_database.db
```

This creates a new database file (or opens an existing one).

### Creating a Table

When creating tables, you must define the structure including column names and data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);
```

**Key Points:** 🚀
- `CREATE TABLE` command creates a new table
- Column names followed by data types (e.g., `TEXT`, `INTEGER`)
- Always include `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` (auto-increments from 1)
- Keywords in UPPERCASE by convention (case-insensitive)
- Column names are followed by their data type (TEXT, INTEGER, etc.)
- Every table should have an `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column
- Primary keys are unique and auto-incrementing (start at 1)
- SQL commands are case-insensitive, but UPPERCASE for keywords is convention

### Altering a Table

Add a new column to an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE cats ADD COLUMN breed TEXT;
```

Check your table structure:

```bash
.schema
```

**💡 SQLite Tip:** Altering/dropping columns is limited; use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` for complex changes.

### Dropping a Table

Delete a table completely:

```sql
DROP TABLE cats;
```

Exit SQLite:

```bash
.quit
```

---

## ✏️ Lesson 2: Writing SQL in a Text Editor

Instead of typing commands directly in the terminal, you can write SQL in `.sql` files and execute them.

### 📝 Workflow

1. **Create** `.sql` file (e.g., `add_column.sql`)
2. **Write** SQL:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE animals ADD COLUMN price INTEGER;
   ```
3. **Run**: `sqlite3 animals_database.db < add_column.sql`

**Benefits:** Version control, reusability, easier debugging. 🛠️

## 🔤 Lesson 3: Data Types in SQL

### Why Data Types Matter

Typing allows databases to:
- Store data efficiently
- Perform operations predictably (e.g., SUM, sorting)
- Validate and restrict data
- Prevent messy, inconsistent data

**Example Problem:**

| name       | breed              | age |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| Maru       | Scottish Fold     | 3   |
| Hannah     | Tabby             | two |
| Lil' Bub   | American Shorthair| 5.5 |

Without proper typing, operations like `SUM(age)` become unpredictable.

### SQLite Data Types

SQLite has 5 basic data type categories:

#### 1. **NULL**
Represents "no value" (like `null` in JavaScript or `None` in Python)

#### 2. **TEXT**
Any alphanumeric characters as plain text
- Names, email addresses, descriptions
- Example: `'Maru'`, `'Scottish Fold'`

#### 3. **INTEGER**
Whole numbers without decimals
- Use for: IDs, ages, counts, quantities
- Allows mathematical operations and numeric sorting
- Example: `3`, `42`, `1000`

#### 4. **REAL**
Decimal numbers (floating point)
- SQLite stores up to 15 characters
- Example: `1.3`, `2.25`, `1234.5678912345`
- Called "double precision" in other databases

#### 5. **BLOB**
Binary Large Object - stores binary data
- Not commonly used in basic operations
- Example: images, files

### Bonus: Type Compatibility

SQLite accepts common datatypes from other databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL):
- `INT` → stored as `INTEGER`
- `BOOLEAN` → stored as `INTEGER` (0 = false, 1 = true)
- `VARCHAR` → stored as `TEXT`

## ➕➡️📖✏️🗑️ Lesson 4: CRUD Operations

**CRUD** = Create, Read, Update, Delete

> 🔗 [GitHub Repository with Examples](https://github.com/try-ronnie/python-p3-sql-crud)

> ⚠️ **Remember:** All SQL commands must end with a semicolon (`;`)

---

### 1. CREATE - INSERT INTO

Add new data to a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES ('Maru', 3, 'Scottish Fold');
```

**Syntax:**
```sql
INSERT INTO [table_name] (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

**Key Points:**
- You don't need to specify the `id` column - it auto-increments
- Column names go in the first parentheses
- Values go in the second parentheses after `VALUES`
- This works in both terminal and `.sql` files

---

### 2. READ - SELECT FROM

Retrieve data from a table.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT [column_names] FROM [table_name];
```

#### Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM cats;
```

#### Select All Columns (Wildcard)

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

The `*` wildcard means "all columns".

---

### Using DISTINCT

Remove duplicate rows from results:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;
```

#### Example:

**Without DISTINCT:**
```sql
SELECT name FROM cats;
```
Result:
```
LUNA
TEMBO
LUNA
GOMA
```

**With DISTINCT:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;
```
Result:
```
LUNA
TEMBO
GOMA
```

#### DISTINCT with Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, age FROM cats;
```

Result:
```
LUNA  - 5
TEMBO - 3
GOMA  - 12
LUNA  - 6
```

Notice: Both "LUNA" entries remain because they have different ages.

**🎯 Key Rule:**

DISTINCT removes rows where **ALL** selected column values are exactly the same.

It does NOT:
- Identify "original" rows
- Compare IDs unless you select them
- Know which record came first (unless you use `ORDER BY`)

**🧩 Mental Model:**

Think of DISTINCT as putting results in a basket and saying: "If I already saw this exact combination before, don't show it again."

---

### Using WHERE Clause

Filter results based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [table_name] WHERE [column_name] = [value];
```

#### Examples:

```sql
-- Find a specific cat
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = 'Maru';

-- Find young cats
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age < 2;

-- Find cats of a specific breed
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE breed = 'Scottish Fold';
```

**Comparison Operators:**
- `=` equal to
- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `!=` or `<>` not equal to

> 💡 **Remember:** What follows `SELECT` is the column(s) to retrieve. The `WHERE` clause filters which rows to return.

---

### 3. UPDATE

Modify existing data in a table:

```sql
UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value] WHERE [column_name] = [value];
```

#### Example:

```sql
UPDATE school SET name = 'John' WHERE UPPER(TRIM(name)) = 'KAMOTHO';
```

**Three Steps:**
1. Specify which table: `UPDATE school`
2. Set the new value: `SET name = 'John'`
3. Identify which row(s): `WHERE name = 'KAMOTHO'`

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Always use a `WHERE` clause! Without it, ALL rows will be updated.

---

### 4. DELETE

Remove rows from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [column_name] = [value];
```

#### Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM school WHERE UPPER(TRIM(name)) = 'DJ KHALID';
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Always use a `WHERE` clause! Without it, ALL rows will be deleted.

---

## ✂️ Lesson 5: String Functions & Data Cleaning

### SQLite Output Formatting

Format your query results in the terminal:

```bash
.headers on       # Show column names
.mode column      # Enable column mode
.width auto       # Auto-adjust column width
# or
.width 10, 20     # Custom column widths
```

---

### Common String Functions

#### 1. TRIM / LTRIM / RTRIM

Remove whitespace from strings:

```sql
TRIM(column)        -- removes spaces from both ends
LTRIM(column)       -- removes spaces from the left
RTRIM(column)       -- removes spaces from the right
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT TRIM(name) FROM school;
DELETE FROM school WHERE TRIM(name) = 'DJ KHALID';
```

**💡 Tip:** Check for hidden spaces:
```sql
SELECT '"' || name || '"' FROM school;
```
This wraps names in quotes so you can see extra spaces.

---

#### 2. UPPER / LOWER

Convert strings to uppercase or lowercase:

```sql
SELECT * FROM school WHERE UPPER(TRIM(name)) = 'DJ KHALID';
SELECT LOWER(name) FROM school;
```

Useful for case-insensitive comparisons.

---

#### 3. LENGTH

Count characters in a string:

```sql
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) FROM school;
```

Helpful for finding trailing spaces or validating data.

---

#### 4. SUBSTR

Extract part of a string:

```sql
SUBSTR(column, start, length)
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(name, 1, 5) FROM school;
-- Returns first 5 characters
```

---

#### 5. REPLACE

Replace all occurrences of a substring:

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(name, ' ', '') FROM school;
-- Removes all spaces from names
```

---

#### 6. LIKE / GLOB

Pattern matching:

```sql
SELECT * FROM school WHERE name LIKE 'DJ KHALID%';
-- % = any characters after "dj khalid"
```

**Wildcards:**
- `%` - matches any sequence of characters
- `_` - matches any single character

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Names starting with 'A'
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Names ending with 'y'
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name LIKE '%y';

-- Names with 'ar' anywhere
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name LIKE '%ar%';
```

---

### Robust Data Cleaning Pattern

Combine functions for bulletproof queries:

```sql
DELETE FROM school
WHERE UPPER(TRIM(name)) = 'DJ KHALID';
```

This pattern:
- Removes leading/trailing spaces with `TRIM()`
- Ignores case differences with `UPPER()`
- Handles inconsistent user input

**Use this approach when:**
- User input might have extra spaces
- Case sensitivity could cause issues
- Data quality is inconsistent

## Best Practices

1. ✅ Always use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` for id columns
2. ✅ End all SQL commands with semicolons (`;`)
3. ✅ Use `WHERE` clauses with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` to avoid affecting all rows
4. ✅ Use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate results
5. ✅ Use `TRIM()` and `UPPER()`/`LOWER()` for robust string comparisons
6. ✅ Write SQL in `.sql` files for reusability
7. ✅ Use meaningful table and column names
8. ✅ Choose appropriate data types for your data
9. ✅ Always pair `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` so results are predictable
10. ✅ Use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` — never `= NULL`
11. ✅ Use `table.column` notation in any query involving more than one table
12. ✅ Use a join table for many-to-many relationships

## Lesson 6: Query Manipulators

### 1. ORDER BY

`ORDER BY` lets you sort the rows returned by a `SELECT` statement in ascending or descending order.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
```

- `ASC` — ascending (smallest to largest, A to Z). Default if not specified.
- `DESC` — descending (largest to smallest, Z to A).

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC;
```

Result:

```
id   name       age   breed               owner_id
---  ---------  ---   ------------------  --------
4    Moe        10    Tabby
3    Lil' Bub   5     American Shorthair
1    Maru       3     Scottish Fold       1
5    Patches    2     Calico
2    Hana       1     Tabby               1
```

The cats are sorted oldest to youngest. Swap `DESC` for `ASC` and you get youngest to oldest.

**ORDER BY multiple columns:**

The second column acts as a tiebreaker when the first has equal values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;
```

Sorts students by age descending; students with the same age are then sorted alphabetically by name.

---

### 2. LIMIT

`LIMIT` controls how many rows are returned. Most useful paired with `ORDER BY` to get the top or bottom N records.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC LIMIT n;
```

**Example — get the oldest cat:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Sorts all cats oldest to youngest, returns only the first row.

**Example — get the 2 oldest cats:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 2;
```

**Example from your school database:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM school ORDER BY age LIMIT 1;
```

Returns the youngest student in the school table.

> **LIMIT without ORDER BY** returns an arbitrary set of rows — the database picks whichever it finds first. Always pair LIMIT with ORDER BY when order matters.

**LIMIT with OFFSET — skip rows:**

`OFFSET` tells SQL how many rows to skip before starting to return results. Useful for pagination.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
```

Skips the 2 oldest cats, then returns the next 2. So if you had 5 cats sorted by age, this gives you cats ranked 3rd and 4th oldest.

---

### 3. BETWEEN

`BETWEEN` filters rows where a column's value falls within a range, inclusive of both endpoints.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

**Example from your school database:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM school WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

Result:

```
name       age   stream   salary
---------  ---   ------   ------
dj khalid  13    east     45000
KAMOTHO    12    EAST     75000
kinuthia   12    EAST     23000
scott      12    EAST     12000
KAMAU      16    WEST     142000
```

`BETWEEN 10 AND 20` includes both 10 and 20. It is equivalent to `WHERE age >= 10 AND age <= 20`.

**NOT BETWEEN — the inverse:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM school WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
```

Returns all students whose age is outside that range — younger than 10 or older than 20.

**BETWEEN also works on text (alphabetical range) and dates:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'M';
```

---

### 4. NULL

`NULL` represents a missing or unknown value. You can insert a row with `NULL` in any column that doesn't have a `NOT NULL` constraint.

**Inserting a row with NULL values:**

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (NULL, NULL, 'Tabby');
```

This inserts a cat with no name and no age — only the breed is known.

**Querying for NULL values:**

You cannot use `=` to check for NULL. You must use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`:

```sql
-- Find all cats with no name
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Find all cats that do have a name
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
```

> `WHERE name = NULL` will never return any rows — NULL is not equal to anything, not even itself. Always use `IS NULL`.

**Updating NULL values:**

```sql
UPDATE cats SET name = 'Unknown' WHERE name IS NULL;
```

This finds all cats with no name and sets them to `'Unknown'`.

---

### 5. COUNT and Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions operate on a group of rows and return a single value. `COUNT` is the most common.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(owner_id) FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;
```

Returns the number of cats that belong to owner 1.

**COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column):**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cats;       -- counts all rows including NULLs
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM cats;    -- counts only rows where name is NOT NULL
```

> The difference matters when your column has NULL values. `COUNT(*)` counts the row regardless. `COUNT(column)` skips it if that column is NULL.

All aggregate functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `COUNT(column)` | Number of non-NULL values |
| `SUM(column)` | Total of all values |
| `AVG(column)` | Average of all values |
| `MIN(column)` | Smallest value |
| `MAX(column)` | Largest value |

---

### 6. GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` groups rows that share the same value in a column, then lets you run aggregate functions on each group separately.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT breed, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed;
```

Result:

```
breed               COUNT(breed)
------------------  ------------
American Shorthair  1
Calico              1
Scottish Fold       1
Tabby               3
```

Instead of counting all cats, it counts cats per breed. Each unique breed becomes its own group.

**GROUP BY with multiple aggregates:**

```sql
SELECT breed, COUNT(breed), AVG(age) FROM cats GROUP BY breed;
```

Gives you the count and average age per breed in one query.

**HAVING — filtering groups:**

`WHERE` filters individual rows before grouping. `HAVING` filters groups after grouping.

```sql
SELECT breed, COUNT(breed) AS total
FROM cats
GROUP BY breed
HAVING total > 1;
```

Only returns breeds that have more than 1 cat. `HAVING` is to `GROUP BY` what `WHERE` is to `SELECT`.

> **Order of clauses matters:** `SELECT` → `FROM` → `WHERE` → `GROUP BY` → `HAVING` → `ORDER BY` → `LIMIT`. You can't use `HAVING` before `GROUP BY` or `WHERE` after `HAVING`.

---

### 7. The `tableName.columnName` Notation

You can prefix any column with its table name to be explicit about where it comes from:

```sql
-- Both return the same result:
SELECT name FROM cats;
SELECT cats.name FROM cats;
```

This becomes essential when querying multiple tables that share column names:

```sql
-- This causes an error:
SELECT name FROM cats, dogs;
-- Error: ambiguous column name: name

-- This works:
SELECT cats.name, dogs.name FROM cats, dogs;
```

You'll use this constantly in JOINs — covered in Lesson 7.

**Quick reference — Lesson 6 modifiers:**

| Modifier | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ORDER BY` | Sort results | `ORDER BY age DESC` |
| `LIMIT` | Cap number of rows | `LIMIT 5` |
| `OFFSET` | Skip rows | `LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10` |
| `BETWEEN` | Range filter | `WHERE age BETWEEN 10 AND 20` |
| `IS NULL` | Check for missing value | `WHERE name IS NULL` |
| `COUNT()` | Count rows | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cats` |
| `GROUP BY` | Group rows | `GROUP BY breed` |
| `HAVING` | Filter groups | `HAVING COUNT(breed) > 1` |

#### Exercise: Organizing Bears Lab

**Learning Goals:**
- Use SQL to store data and retrieve it later on
- Use SQLite to build relational databases on your computer
- Perform CRUD operations on relational databases using SQL

**Lab file structure:**

```
├── lib/
│   ├── create.sql      # where you CREATE your schema
│   ├── insert.sql      # where you INSERT your data
│   ├── seed.sql        # data for in-memory test database
│   └── sql_queries.py  # where you write your SELECT queries
└── testing/
    ├── create_test.py  # tests your create.sql
    ├── insert_test.py  # tests your insert.sql
    ├── select_test.py  # tests queries in sql_queries.py
    └── conftest.py     # pytest configuration
```

**Part 1: CREATE TABLE** — write in `lib/create.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bears (
  id          INTEGER,
  name        TEXT,
  age         INTEGER,
  sex         TEXT,
  color       TEXT,
  temperament TEXT,
  alive       BOOLEAN
);
```

**Part 2: INSERT** — write in `lib/insert.sql`. Add these 8 bears:
Mr. Chocolate, Rowdy, Tabitha, Sergeant Brown, Melissa, Grinch, Wendy, and one unnamed bear (use `NULL` for name).

**Part 3: SELECT** — write queries as Python strings in `lib/sql_queries.py`:

```python
select_all_female_bears_return_name_and_age = """
    SELECT bears.name, bears.age
    FROM bears
    WHERE sex = 'F';
"""
```

The test database uses an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(":memory:")`). This means the database is wiped clean after every test run — no leftover data between runs.

## Lesson 7: SQL JOINS

So far you've been working with one table at a time. But real databases are made of **multiple related tables** — and that's where JOINs come in.

A JOIN lets you pull data from two or more tables in a single query, by linking them through a shared column — usually a **foreign key**.

A **foreign key** is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. In your school database, `students_teachers.student_id` is a foreign key that references `students.id`. That link is what makes the JOIN possible.

Before we dive in, let's look at the tables we'll be using throughout this lesson. These come straight from your `example 4` folder.

### The Tables We're Working With

**students table** — created in `CREATE students.table.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (age > 10 AND age < 18),
  gender TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F'))
);
```

**teacher table** — created in `CREATE teacher.table.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (age > 25 AND age < 65),
  gender TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F'))
);
```

**students_teachers (join table)** — created in `CREATE join_table.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students_teachers(
  student_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  teacher_id INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

This middle table is called a **join table** (also known as a bridge table or associative table). It doesn't hold names or ages — it just holds relationships. It says: "student with id X is linked to teacher with id Y."

Notice there is no `id` column in `students_teachers`. That's intentional — the combination of `student_id` and `teacher_id` together identifies each relationship. You could add a primary key if needed, but for a simple join table it's not required.

**Data inserted** — from `INSERT students_values.sql`, `INSERT teacher_values.sql`, `INSERT join_table_data.sql`:

```sql
-- students
INSERT INTO students (name, age, gender) VALUES
  ('bob', 15, 'M'), ('dogo', 15, 'F'), ('Tabitha', 17, 'F'),
  ('Tindo', 17, 'M'), ('Matata', 12, 'M'), ('jamaml', 15, 'M'),
  ('Joe', 11, 'M'), ('George', 14, 'M'), ('rose', 16, 'F'),
  ('Maria', 17, 'F'), ('Maggie', 17, 'F');

-- teachers
INSERT INTO teacher (name, age, gender) VALUES
  ('Kamotho', 45, 'M'), ('Kinuthia', 46, 'M'),
  ('Muthoni', 55, 'F'), ('Rachel', 35, 'F');

-- relationships (who teaches who)
INSERT INTO students_teachers (student_id, teacher_id) VALUES
  (8, 1), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 1);
```

So looking at the join table data:
- Student 8 (George) is taught by Teacher 1 (Kamotho)
- Student 9 (rose) is taught by Teacher 3 (Muthoni)
- Student 10 (Maria) is taught by Teacher 2 (Kinuthia) AND Teacher 1 (Kamotho) — she has **two** teachers
- Students 1–7 and 11 have **no teacher assigned** — they exist in the students table but have no row in students_teachers
- Teacher 4 (Rachel) has **no students assigned** — she exists in the teacher table but has no row in students_teachers

> This is intentional. Real databases always have gaps like this. Some students haven't been assigned yet. Some teachers are new. JOINs are how you decide what to do with those gaps.

This is the exact setup that makes JOINs interesting. Keep this data in mind as we go through each join type — you'll see how each one handles these gaps differently.

---

### Why JOINs Exist

Imagine you want to answer: *"What are the names of the students taught by Kamotho?"*

The `students` table has names. The `teacher` table has Kamotho. The `students_teachers` table connects them. No single table has all the information — you need to JOIN them.

Without JOINs, you'd have to run multiple queries and manually match the results in your head or in code:

```sql
-- Step 1: find Kamotho's id
SELECT id FROM teacher WHERE name = 'Kamotho';
-- returns: 1

-- Step 2: find student_ids linked to teacher 1
SELECT student_id FROM students_teachers WHERE teacher_id = 1;
-- returns: 8, 10

-- Step 3: find names for those student ids
SELECT name FROM students WHERE id IN (8, 10);
-- returns: George, Maria
```

That's 3 separate queries. JOINs collapse all of that into one:

```sql
SELECT students.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id
WHERE teacher.name = 'Kamotho';
```

One query. Same result. That's the power of JOINs.

### The JOIN Family — Overview

Here are all the JOIN types we'll cover:

| JOIN Type | What it returns | Includes unmatched left? | Includes unmatched right? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INNER JOIN` | Only rows with a match in BOTH tables | No | No |
| `LEFT JOIN` | All rows from the left table + matched rows from the right | Yes | No |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | All rows from the right table + matched rows from the left | No | Yes |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | All rows from both tables, matched where possible | Yes | Yes |
| `CROSS JOIN` | Every combination of rows from both tables | N/A | N/A |
| `SELF JOIN` | A table joined to itself | Depends on join type used | Depends on join type used |

SQLite supports INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and SELF JOIN natively. RIGHT JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN can be simulated using LEFT JOIN with table order swapped or UNION.

---

### 1. INNER JOIN

An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a **matching value in both tables**. If a row in the left table has no match in the right table (or vice versa), it is completely excluded from the result.

Think of it as the **intersection** — only what both tables agree on. Like a Venn diagram where you only care about the overlapping middle part.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.shared_column = table2.shared_column;
```

**Your example** — from `SELECT student_of_tch3.sql`:

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.id
FROM students
INNER JOIN students_teachers
ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
WHERE students_teachers.teacher_id = 1;
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- `SELECT students.name, students.id` — we want the student's name and id
- `FROM students` — start from the students table (this is the **left** table)
- `INNER JOIN students_teachers` — join it with the students_teachers table (the **right** table)
- `ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id` — the link: match rows where the student's id equals the student_id in the join table
- `WHERE students_teachers.teacher_id = 1` — filter: only keep rows where the teacher is Kamotho (id = 1)

**Result:**

```
name    id
------  --
George  8
Maria   10
```

Only George (id 8) and Maria (id 10) have a row in `students_teachers` with `teacher_id = 1`. Everyone else is excluded — including students with no teacher at all.

**Another example** — get all students and their teachers (no WHERE filter):

```sql
SELECT students.name, teacher.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id;
```

Result:

```
students.name  teacher.name
-------------  ------------
George         Kamotho
rose           Muthoni
Maria          Kinuthia
Maria          Kamotho
```

Notice: bob, dogo, Tabitha, Tindo, Matata, jamaml, Joe, Maggie — all excluded. They have no entry in `students_teachers`. Rachel (teacher) is also excluded — she has no students.

That's INNER JOIN: **strict, no gaps, only confirmed matches**.

> **Key rule:** If either side of the ON condition is NULL or has no match, that row is dropped entirely. INNER JOIN is the most restrictive join — it only keeps rows that exist in both tables.

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN (also called LEFT OUTER JOIN)

A LEFT JOIN returns **all rows from the left table**, and the matched rows from the right table. If a row in the left table has no match in the right table, it still appears in the result — but the columns from the right table will be `NULL`.

Think of it as: *"Give me everything from the left, and attach whatever you can find from the right. If you can't find anything, just leave it blank (NULL)."*

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.shared_column = table2.shared_column;
```

**Example using your tables** — get all students and their teacher (if they have one):

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.id, teacher.name AS teacher_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
LEFT JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id;
```

Result:

```
name     id   teacher_name
-------  ---  ------------
bob      1    NULL
dogo     2    NULL
Tabitha  3    NULL
Tindo    4    NULL
Matata   5    NULL
jamaml   6    NULL
Joe      7    NULL
George   8    Kamotho
rose     9    Muthoni
Maria    10   Kinuthia
Maria    10   Kamotho
Maggie   11   NULL
```

Every student shows up. The ones with no teacher get `NULL` in the `teacher_name` column. Maria appears twice because she has two teachers.

**When to use LEFT JOIN:**
- When you want to see all records from one table regardless of whether they have a match
- When you want to find records with **no match** (unassigned students, orphaned records, etc.)
- When you're building reports and need every entity to appear even if they have zero activity

**Finding students with NO teacher assigned:**

```sql
SELECT students.name, students.id
FROM students
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
WHERE students_teachers.student_id IS NULL;
```

Result:

```
name     id
-------  --
bob      1
dogo     2
Tabitha  3
Tindo    4
Matata   5
jamaml   6
Joe      7
Maggie   11
```

This is a very common pattern — LEFT JOIN + `WHERE right_table.column IS NULL` to find records that have **no relationship**. It's sometimes called an **anti-join** or **exclusion join**.

The logic: after the LEFT JOIN, any student with no match in `students_teachers` will have `NULL` in the `students_teachers.student_id` column. Filtering for `IS NULL` gives you exactly those students.

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (also called RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

A RIGHT JOIN is the mirror image of a LEFT JOIN. It returns **all rows from the right table**, and the matched rows from the left table. If a row in the right table has no match in the left table, it still appears — with `NULL` for the left table's columns.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.shared_column = table2.shared_column;
```

> **SQLite note:** SQLite does not natively support RIGHT JOIN. You can achieve the same result by swapping the table order and using a LEFT JOIN instead. This is not a limitation in practice — every RIGHT JOIN can be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN by putting the "right" table first.

**Example** — get all teachers and their students (if they have any):

```sql
-- Standard SQL (works in MySQL, PostgreSQL)
SELECT students.name AS student_name, teacher.name AS teacher_name
FROM students_teachers
RIGHT JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id
LEFT JOIN students ON students_teachers.student_id = students.id;
```

**SQLite equivalent** (swap tables, use LEFT JOIN):

```sql
SELECT students.name AS student_name, teacher.name AS teacher_name
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON teacher.id = students_teachers.teacher_id
LEFT JOIN students ON students_teachers.student_id = students.id;
```

Result:

```
student_name  teacher_name
------------  ------------
George        Kamotho
Maria         Kamotho
rose          Muthoni
Maria         Kinuthia
NULL          Rachel
```

Rachel appears even though she has no students — her `student_name` is `NULL`. That's the RIGHT JOIN behaviour: the right table (teacher) is fully preserved.

**Finding teachers with NO students (anti-join from the right side):**

```sql
SELECT teacher.name
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON teacher.id = students_teachers.teacher_id
WHERE students_teachers.teacher_id IS NULL;
```

Result: `Rachel` — the only teacher with no students assigned.

**When to use RIGHT JOIN:**
- When you want all records from the right table regardless of matches
- Finding teachers with no students, products with no orders, categories with no items, etc.
- In practice, most developers just flip the table order and use LEFT JOIN — same result, more widely supported

---

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

A FULL OUTER JOIN returns **all rows from both tables**. Where there's a match, the columns are filled in. Where there's no match on either side, `NULL` fills the gaps.

Think of it as LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN combined — you get everything, matched or not. In a Venn diagram, this is the entire circle — both sides plus the overlap.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.shared_column = table2.shared_column;
```

> **SQLite note:** SQLite does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. You simulate it using `LEFT JOIN` combined with `UNION` and another `LEFT JOIN` with tables swapped. The `UNION` keyword merges the two result sets and removes duplicate rows automatically.

**SQLite simulation:**

```sql
-- All students with their teachers (LEFT side)
SELECT students.name AS student_name, teacher.name AS teacher_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
LEFT JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id

UNION

-- All teachers with their students (RIGHT side — catches unmatched teachers)
SELECT students.name AS student_name, teacher.name AS teacher_name
FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN students_teachers ON teacher.id = students_teachers.teacher_id
LEFT JOIN students ON students_teachers.student_id = students.id;
```

Result:

```
student_name  teacher_name
------------  ------------
bob           NULL
dogo          NULL
Tabitha       NULL
Tindo         NULL
Matata        NULL
jamaml        NULL
Joe           NULL
George        Kamotho
rose          Muthoni
Maria         Kinuthia
Maria         Kamotho
Maggie        NULL
NULL          Rachel
```

Every student and every teacher appears. Unmatched students get `NULL` for teacher. Rachel (unmatched teacher) gets `NULL` for student.

> **Why use UNION and not UNION ALL?** `UNION` removes duplicate rows automatically. `UNION ALL` keeps all rows including duplicates. In the FULL OUTER JOIN simulation, matched rows would appear in both halves — `UNION` deduplicates them so you only see each matched pair once.

**When to use FULL OUTER JOIN:**
- Auditing — find all unmatched records on both sides at once
- Data reconciliation between two datasets
- Merging two tables where either side may have records the other doesn't
- Reporting dashboards where you need to show all entities regardless of activity

---

### 5. CROSS JOIN

A CROSS JOIN returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables — every row from the left table is combined with every row from the right table. No `ON` condition is needed because you're not matching anything — you're combining everything.

If table A has 11 rows and table B has 4 rows, a CROSS JOIN gives you 11 × 4 = **44 rows**.

The name "Cartesian product" comes from mathematics — it's the set of all ordered pairs from two sets. In SQL terms: every possible pairing.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

**Example** — pair every student with every teacher:

```sql
SELECT students.name AS student, teacher.name AS teacher
FROM students
CROSS JOIN teacher;
```

This gives you 11 students × 4 teachers = **44 rows**. Every possible student-teacher pairing.

```
student   teacher
--------  --------
bob       Kamotho
bob       Kinuthia
bob       Muthoni
bob       Rachel
dogo      Kamotho
dogo      Kinuthia
... (44 rows total)
```

**When to use CROSS JOIN:**
- Generating all possible combinations (e.g., scheduling, seating arrangements)
- Creating test data
- Building a matrix of options (sizes × colors, students × subjects)
- Generating a calendar grid (days × time slots)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** CROSS JOIN on large tables can produce enormous result sets. 1000 rows × 1000 rows = 1,000,000 rows. Use with care.

**Filtering a CROSS JOIN:**

You can add a `WHERE` clause to a CROSS JOIN to filter the combinations down:

```sql
SELECT students.name AS student, teacher.name AS teacher
FROM students
CROSS JOIN teacher
WHERE teacher.gender = 'F';
```

This gives every student paired with only the female teachers — 11 students × 2 female teachers = 22 rows.

---

### 6. SELF JOIN

A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined **to itself**. This sounds strange at first, but it's useful when rows in a table have a relationship with other rows in the same table.

To do a self join, you use table aliases — you give the same table two different names so SQL can tell them apart. Without aliases, SQL wouldn't know which "students" you mean when you write `students.id = students.id`.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT a.column, b.column
FROM table_name AS a
INNER JOIN table_name AS b
ON a.shared_column = b.related_column;
```

**Example** — find all pairs of students who are the same age:

```sql
SELECT a.name AS student1, b.name AS student2, a.age
FROM students AS a
INNER JOIN students AS b
ON a.age = b.age
WHERE a.id < b.id;
```

The `WHERE a.id < b.id` prevents duplicates — without it you'd get (bob, dogo) AND (dogo, bob), plus each student paired with themselves. The `<` ensures each pair only appears once, and a student is never paired with themselves.

Result (partial):

```
student1  student2  age
--------  --------  ---
bob       dogo      15
bob       jamaml    15
dogo      jamaml    15
Tabitha   Tindo     17
Tabitha   Maria     17
Tabitha   Maggie    17
Tindo     Maria     17
Tindo     Maggie    17
Maria     Maggie    17
```

**Another real-world use case** — imagine a table of employees where each row has a `manager_id` that references another employee's `id` in the same table:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN employees AS m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

The CEO or top-level employee has no manager, so their `manager_id` is NULL. Using LEFT JOIN ensures they still appear in the result with `NULL` for manager — INNER JOIN would drop them entirely.

**When to use SELF JOIN:**
- Hierarchical data (employees and their managers, categories and subcategories)
- Finding duplicate or related records within the same table
- Comparing rows within the same table
- Finding students/employees/items that share a common attribute (same age, same department, same price)

---

### 7. The JOIN Table Pattern (Many-to-Many Relationships)

Your `students_teachers` table is a perfect example of a **join table** — the standard way to model a many-to-many relationship in SQL.

The relationship here is: one student can have many teachers, and one teacher can have many students. You can't store that in just two tables without repeating data. The join table solves this cleanly.

**Why not just add a `teacher_id` column to the students table?**

Because Maria has TWO teachers. If you added `teacher_id` to the students table, you'd need two rows for Maria — duplicating her name, age, and gender. That's messy and inconsistent. The join table keeps each entity in one place and only stores the relationship separately.

Here's the same pattern from your `python-p3-creating-join-tables` folder:

```sql
-- from create_join_table.sql
CREATE TABLE cat_owners(
  cat_id INTEGER,
  owner_id INTEGER
);
```

And the query to find the owner of cat 3:

```sql
-- from SELECT owners_name of cat 3.sql
SELECT owner.name
FROM owner
INNER JOIN cat_owners
ON owner.id = cat_owners.owner_id
WHERE cat_owners.cat_id = 3;
```

Same pattern as your school database — just cats and owners instead of students and teachers. The logic is identical:
1. Start from the table you want data from (`owner`)
2. JOIN through the join table (`cat_owners`)
3. Filter by the id you're looking for (`cat_id = 3`)

This 3-step mental model works for any many-to-many JOIN query you'll ever write.

---

### 8. Using Table Aliases in JOINs

As your queries get longer, typing full table names repeatedly gets tedious. SQL lets you use **aliases** — short nicknames for tables — using the `AS` keyword (or just a space).

```sql
-- Without aliases
SELECT students.name, teacher.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN students_teachers ON students.id = students_teachers.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher ON students_teachers.teacher_id = teacher.id;

-- With aliases (much cleaner)
SELECT s.name AS student_name, t.name AS teacher_name
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN students_teachers AS st ON s.id = st.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher AS t ON st.teacher_id = t.id;
```

Both queries return the same result. The aliased version is easier to read and write, especially with 3+ table joins.

> **Convention:** Single-letter aliases (`s`, `t`, `st`) are common for short queries. For complex queries with many tables, use more descriptive aliases like `stud`, `tchr` to keep things readable.

---

### 9. Joining More Than Two Tables

You're not limited to two tables. You can chain as many JOINs as you need. Each JOIN adds another table to the query.

**Example** — get student names, their teacher names, and filter to only female teachers:

```sql
SELECT s.name AS student, t.name AS teacher, t.gender
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN students_teachers AS st ON s.id = st.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher AS t ON st.teacher_id = t.id
WHERE t.gender = 'F';
```

Result:

```
student  teacher   gender
-------  -------   ------
rose     Muthoni   F
```

Only rose is taught by a female teacher (Muthoni). Maria's teachers are Kamotho and Kinuthia — both male — so she doesn't appear.

> **Reading multi-table JOINs:** Read them top to bottom. Start with `FROM` (your base table), then each `JOIN` adds another table, and `WHERE` filters the combined result. The `ON` clause on each JOIN line is what links that table to the previous ones.

---

### 10. JOIN with Aggregate Functions

You can combine JOINs with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, etc.

**Example** — count how many students each teacher has:

```sql
SELECT t.name AS teacher, COUNT(st.student_id) AS student_count
FROM teacher AS t
LEFT JOIN students_teachers AS st ON t.id = st.teacher_id
GROUP BY t.id, t.name
ORDER BY student_count DESC;
```

Result:

```
teacher   student_count
--------  -------------
Kamotho   2
Kinuthia  1
Muthoni   1
Rachel    0
```

Rachel shows up with 0 because we used LEFT JOIN — she has no students but we still want her in the result. If we used INNER JOIN, Rachel would be excluded entirely.

> **Rule of thumb:** When combining JOINs with `COUNT` or other aggregates, use LEFT JOIN if you want zero-count rows to appear. Use INNER JOIN if you only care about rows with actual data.

**Example** — count how many teachers each student has:

```sql
SELECT s.name AS student, COUNT(st.teacher_id) AS teacher_count
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN students_teachers AS st ON s.id = st.student_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name;
```

Result:

```
student   teacher_count
--------  -------------
bob       0
dogo      0
Tabitha   0
Tindo     0
Matata    0
jamaml    0
Joe       0
George    1
rose      1
Maria     2
Maggie    0
```

---

### 11. The `tableName.columnName` Notation

You already saw this in Lesson 6 — but it becomes **essential** in JOINs. When two tables have a column with the same name (like both having an `id` column), SQL needs you to be explicit about which one you mean.

```sql
-- This is ambiguous and will cause an error:
SELECT id, name FROM students INNER JOIN teacher ON students.id = teacher.id;
-- Error: ambiguous column name: id

-- This is explicit and correct:
SELECT students.id, students.name, teacher.name
FROM students
INNER JOIN teacher ON students.id = teacher.id;
```

Always use `table.column` notation in JOIN queries to avoid ambiguity errors.

> **Tip:** Even when it's not strictly required (e.g., only one table has a column named `name`), using `table.column` notation makes your queries self-documenting — anyone reading the query immediately knows which table each column comes from.

---

### 12. Visual Summary — Which JOIN to Use?

```
  students table          students_teachers          teacher table
  (11 rows)               (4 rows)                   (4 rows)

  bob      (1)                                        Kamotho  (1)
  dogo     (2)                                        Kinuthia (2)
  Tabitha  (3)                                        Muthoni  (3)
  Tindo    (4)                                        Rachel   (4)  <-- no students
  Matata   (5)
  jamaml   (6)            (8,1)  (9,3)
  Joe      (7)            (10,2) (10,1)
  George   (8) ----------> matched
  rose     (9) ----------> matched
  Maria    (10) ----------> matched (twice)
  Maggie   (11)           <-- no teacher
```

Rows 1-7 and 11 in students have no match in students_teachers. Rachel (teacher 4) has no match either. Each JOIN type handles these differently:

| Question | JOIN to use |
|---|---|
| Only students who have a teacher? | `INNER JOIN` |
| All students, show teacher if they have one | `LEFT JOIN` (students on left) |
| All teachers, show students if they have any | `LEFT JOIN` (teacher on left) or `RIGHT JOIN` |
| All students AND all teachers, matched where possible | `FULL OUTER JOIN` (or UNION in SQLite) |
| Every possible student-teacher pairing | `CROSS JOIN` |
| Students who share the same age | `SELF JOIN` |

---

### Quick Reference — JOIN Syntax

```sql
-- INNER JOIN: only matched rows
SELECT s.name, t.name
FROM students s
INNER JOIN students_teachers st ON s.id = st.student_id
INNER JOIN teacher t ON st.teacher_id = t.id;

-- LEFT JOIN: all students, teacher if assigned
SELECT s.name, t.name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN students_teachers st ON s.id = st.student_id
LEFT JOIN teacher t ON st.teacher_id = t.id;

-- Anti-join: students with NO teacher
SELECT s.name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN students_teachers st ON s.id = st.student_id
WHERE st.student_id IS NULL;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN (SQLite simulation)
SELECT s.name, t.name FROM students s
LEFT JOIN students_teachers st ON s.id = st.student_id
LEFT JOIN teacher t ON st.teacher_id = t.id
UNION
SELECT s.name, t.name FROM teacher t
LEFT JOIN students_teachers st ON t.id = st.teacher_id
LEFT JOIN students s ON st.student_id = s.id;

-- CROSS JOIN: every student-teacher combination
SELECT s.name, t.name
FROM students s
CROSS JOIN teacher t;

-- SELF JOIN: students who share the same age
SELECT a.name, b.name
FROM students a
INNER JOIN students b ON a.age = b.age
WHERE a.id < b.id;
```

### Best Practices for JOINs

1. ✅ Always use `table.column` notation to avoid ambiguity
2. ✅ Use aliases (`AS s`, `AS t`) to keep long queries readable
3. ✅ Choose LEFT JOIN over INNER JOIN when you need to preserve unmatched rows
4. ✅ Use a join table for many-to-many relationships
5. ✅ Combine JOINs with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions for powerful queries
6. ✅ Be careful with CROSS JOIN on large tables — the result set grows fast
7. ✅ In SQLite, simulate RIGHT JOIN by swapping table order with LEFT JOIN
8. ✅ In SQLite, simulate FULL OUTER JOIN using `LEFT JOIN ... UNION ... LEFT JOIN`
9. ✅ Use `LEFT JOIN + IS NULL` (anti-join) to find records with no relationship
10. ✅ When in doubt, start with INNER JOIN and loosen to LEFT JOIN if you're missing rows you expected to see
